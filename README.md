## Project Overview

This purpose of this is to analyze what has being taught, beyond the classrom experiences and a project to back it up.
The project will answer questions on how geographical factors as well as the status of a person/family could affect the charges placed on medical services.

## Tools

#### For Analysis:

 - Structured Query Language(SQL) : For data quering and database management

 - Microsoft Excel : For creating dashboards and gaining more insights into the data

#### For Portfolio Building and Showcase of Project:

 - Github

## Knowledge obtained from the training

- How to get the right data for answering proposed questions questions

- Techniques on how to conduct data inspection and cleaning

- How to use Excel functions

- How to write SQL queries

- How to visualize ad manipulate data to provide reasonable insights

- Critical thinking


## Process

- Question definition
- Getting and loading data
- Data observation and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis(EDA)
- Descriptive, diagonistic, predictive and prescriptive Analysis
- Visualizations to demostrate insights

  - ## Question Definition
  This project aims to answer for patterns influencing medical billing by exploring relationship between several variables and medical charges(target variable) and as well make informed decisions.
  
  - ## Data Source
  The health cost data used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

  - ## Data Cleaning
  The dataset was filtered through to check for missing data and outliers which can be seen in the data filtering file.
  I also checked for duplicates using conditional formatting on excel.
  Additionally, I was able to eliminate excess decimals and added a currency to the costs on the dataset I'm working on.



  |Geographical regions|	Average of medical charges|
  |----------|-------------------|
  |Northeast	|13406.38|
  |Northwest	|12417.57|
  |Southeast |14735.41|
  |Southwest	|12346.93|
  |Grand Total|	13270.42|
